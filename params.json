{"name":"CLV Research","tagline":"Comparing statistical models for Customer Lifetime Value","body":"### Research introduction\r\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a prediction of future profits you expect from a customer. This is an applied research project of Lucie Šperková, Lenka Vraná, Pavel Jašek, Marek Kobulský and Zdeněk Smutný from University of Economics, Prague.\r\n\r\n[Initial page, how we gathered research partners](http://jasek.info/callfordata.html) (in Czech only)\r\n\r\nThis page explains the current state and already published publications from this research.\r\n\r\n### Current state and schedule\r\nWe're currently communicating with some 12 partners who are willing to share their data with us.\r\n* With some of these partners, we've already analyzed and discussed first results.\r\n\r\nBy the end of November, 2015, we'd like to have ready a paper with comparison of statistical models on real-world data.\r\n* Team work of Lucie Šperková, Lenka Vraná, Pavel Jašek, Zdeněk Smutný and Marek Kobulský.\r\n* We've chosen several models to implement and a method to describe how each model fits to a company.\r\n* All outputs from analyses need to be approved by the partner.\r\n* Apart from CLV itself we're analyzing purchase data to justify that the whole concept of Customer Centricity makes sense and has practical implications for marketing management.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Pavel Jašek should have ready his dissertation thesis that would benefit from this research in the following way:\r\n* means of CLV application in marketing management - discussions with marketing managers. Current state of the usage of customer value. Proposal of specific applications of CLV and Customer Equity in the company. The thesis should conclude in metohdology of CLV use in companies.\r\n* case study with selected partners. When a clear measureable example of a campaign that could benefit from CLV data is found, Pavel will propose a pilot test run.\r\n\r\n### Published papers\r\nPapers already published :\r\n* [Jasek - Advances in Performance Management Using Customer Equity](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/papers/Jasek%20-%20Advances%20in%20Performance%20Management%20Using%20Customer%20Equity.pdf)\r\n* [Jasek - Analyzing User Activity Based on RFM Models Complemented with Website Visits and Social Network Interactions](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/papers/Jasek%20-%20Analyzing%20User%20Activity%20Based%20on%20RFM%20Models%20Complemented%20with%20Website%20Visits%20and%20Social%20Network%20Interactions.pdf)\r\n* [Jasek - Impact of Customer Networks on Customer Lifetime Value Models](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/papers/Jasek%20-%20Impact%20of%20Customer%20Networks%20on%20Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20Models.pdf)\r\n* [Jasek and Vrana - Managerial Impacts on Different Computation Models for Customer Lifetime Value for an E-commerce Company](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/papers/Jasek%20and%20Vrana%20-%20Managerial%20Impacts%20on%20Different%20Computation%20Models%20for%20Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20for%20an%20E-commerce%20Company.pdf)\r\n* [Novotny and Jasek - Enhancing Customer Lifetime Value with Perceptual Measures Contained in Enterprise Information Systems](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/papers/Novotny%20and%20Jasek%20-%20Enhancing%20Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20with%20Perceptual%20Measures%20Contained%20in%20Enterprise%20Information%20Systems.pdf)\r\n* [Vrana and Jasek - Persistence Models for Customer Equity](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/papers/Vrana%20and%20Jasek%20-%20Persistence%20Models%20for%20Customer%20Equity.pdf)\r\n\r\nBachelor thesis Pavel worked on:\r\n* [Pešek - Methods of Predicting Customer Lifetime Value](https://github.com/CLVresearch/public/blob/master/bachelor-thesis/Pe%C5%A1ek%20-%20Zp%C5%AFsoby%20predikce%20dlouhodob%C3%A9%20hodnoty%20z%C3%A1kazn%C3%ADka.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nPavel Jašek\r\n* [Twitter @paveljasek](https://www.twitter.com/paveljasek)\r\n* pavel.jasek@vse.cz","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
